## app.attachEvent\(\)

Use this method to attach a custom event.

**Parameters:**

- *name* (string) is the name of the event,
- *handler* (function) the handler for the event.

**Returns:** nothing.

For example, attach a handler to an event from a Jet view:

```javascript
// views/form.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class FormView extends JetView{
    init(){
        this.app.attachEvent("save:form", function(){
            this.show("aftersave");
        });
    }
}
```

Events can be attached both in the app file and in view modules. Yet, if you attach an event listener with this method, you had better to detach it manually with **detachEvent\(\)** to eliminate a possibility of memory leaks.

You can also attach an inner Jet event. For instance, from app:

```javascript
// myapp.js
...
app.attachEvent("app:guard", function(url, view, nav){
    if (url.indexOf("/blocked") !== -1)
        nav.redirect="/somewhere/else";
});
...
```

For more details on events, read ["View Communication"](view-communication.md) and ["Inner Events and Error Handling"](inner-events-and-error-handling.md).

## app.callEvent\(\)

Use this method to call a custom event.

**Parameters:**
- *name* (string) is the name of the event,
- *params* (array) is the array of parameters.

**Returns:** a boolean.

```javascript
// views/data.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class DataView extends JetView{
    config(){
        return {
            view:"button", click:() => {
                this.app.callEvent("save:form");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Normally, inner events are called automatically, so there is no need to use **callEvent** for them.

For more details on events, read ["View Communication"](view-communication.md) and ["Inner Events and Error Handling"](inner-events-and-error-handling.md).

## app.contains()

The method returns *true* if the app contains the view from the parameter and *false* if not.

**Parameters:** a Jet view.

**Returns:** a boolean.

## app.createView()

The **createView** method creates a Jet view based on the UI configuration passed to it as a parameter.

```js
let view = this.app.createView(FormView); // FormView is a Jet view class
this.getRoot().addView(view);
```

**Parameters:**

- **ui** - the UI configuration of the view. It can be defined as:
	- a Webix view object
	- a Jet view class
	- a Jet app class constructor call
	- a Jet view class constructor call
	- a factory function that returns a Webix view object
- **name** (string, optional) - the name of the view

**Returns:** object - the newly created view (instance of a Jet view class)

## app.detachEvent\(\)

Use this method to detach event listeners added by **attachEvent** from Jet view classes. You should do this, because the lifetime of such an event listener is longer than the lifetime of the Jet view. So if the view is destroyed, but the event listener isn't detached, this may cause memory leaks, especially in older browsers.

To detach an event, call **app.detachEvent** when the view that attached the event is destroyed:

```javascript
// views/form.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class FormView extends JetView{
    init(){
        this.app.attachEvent("save:form", function(){
            this.show("aftersave");
        });
    }
    destroy(){
        this.app.detachEvent("save:form");
    }
}
```

For more details on events, read ["View Communication"](view-communication.md) and ["Inner Events and Error Handling"](inner-events-and-error-handling.md).

## app.getService\(\)

The method returns a service by its name. Call this method to use a service:

```javascript
// views/form.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";
import {getData} from "models/records";

export default class FormView extends JetView{
    config(){
        return {
            view:"form", elements:[
                { view:"text", name:"name" }
            ]
        };
    }
    init(){
        var id = this.app.getService("masterTree").getSelected();
        this.getRoot().setValues(getData(id));
    }
}
```

You can read more about services in the ["View Communication"](view-communication.md) chapter.

## app.getSubView()

The method returns the current top view of the app.

**Parameters:** none.

**Returns:** a Jet view (object).

```js
// views/some.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";
export default class FormView extends JetView{
    config(){
        return {/* ...UI */};
	}
	init(){
		const top = this.app.getSubView();
	}
}
```

## app.getUrl()

The method **returns** the app URL as an array of objects, each containing:

- **index** (number) - the index of the URL segment,
- **page** (string) - the segment itself,
- **params** (object) - the list of URL parameters.

```javascript
this.app.getUrl();
/* [
	{ index:1, page:"top", params:{} },
	{ index:2, page:"some", params:{} }
]*/
```

## app.refresh\(\)

If you want to repaint the UI of the application, call _app.refresh\(\)_. It will re-render all the views.

**Parameters:** none.

**Returns:** a promise.

## app.render\(\)

The **render** method builds the UI of the application. If called without any parameters, it just renders the UI of the top view inside the page according to the start URL, specified in the app configuration.

**Optional parameters:**

- *container* (string, HTMLElement, SubView object) where the app will be rendered
- *url* (array,string) URL segments as objects with *page*, *params*, and *index* or a URL as a string

**Returns:** a promise.

```javascript
// myapp.js
...
app.render();
```

But if you want to render the app inside a container, you can pass the string parameter to it with the ID of the container:

```javascript
// myapp.js
...
app.render("mybox");
```

## app.setService\(\)

The method initializes a service for view communication.

**Parameters:**
- *name* (string) is the name of the service,
- *obj* (object) includes all methods and properties of the service that will be available to any view.

```javascript
// views/tree.js
import {JetView} from "webix-jet";

export default class treeView extends JetView{
    config(){
        return { view:"tree" };
    }
    init() {
        this.app.setService("masterTree", {
            getSelected : () => this.getRoot().getSelectedId();
        });
    }
}
```

**this** refers to the instance of the _treeView_ class if it is used in an _arrow function_ [\[1\]](jetapp-api.md#1).

You can read more about services in the ["View Communication"](view-communication.md) chapter.

## app.show\(\)

The **show** method is used to change the app interface. This method rebuilds the whole UI of the app according to the URL passed as a parameter.

**Parameters:**
- *path* (string) is the URL segment(s) according to which you want to change the UI of the app

**Returns:** a promise.

```javascript
// views/some.js
...
app.show("/demo/details")
```

For more info about showing UI components, visit the ["Navigation"](navigation.md) chapter.

## app.use\(\)

The **use** method is used to switch on plugins.

**Parameters:**
* *plugin* (Jet Plugin) the plugin
* the plugin *configuration* (see details for each plugin in the ["Plugins"](plugins.md) chapter)

**Returns:** nothing.

```javascript
// myapp.js
import session from "models/session";
...
app.use(plugins.User, { model: session });
```
